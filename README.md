Scripulous Fingore is a gaming urban legend, a character said to be hidden in many games, included in the files but never actually used.

This mod finally brings him to life, something that shouldâ€™ve happened a long time ago; he is a hostile mob that spawns in the darkness.

Scripulous Fingore is also very smart, infact every time you will say something in chat, he will brillantly answer: "Nuh uh".
